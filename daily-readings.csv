1,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,WE OF Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the reader will be interested in the medical esti- mate,any pic- ture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical factor is incomplete.,Alcoholism is not just bad behavior; it is a condition involving both body and mind.,"A modern view describes alcohol use disorder as a chronic medical and psychological condition influenced by brain changes, learning, thoughts, emotions, relationships, and environment rather than simple bad choices or weak character. Motivational interviewing (a collaborative counseling style that explores and resolves ambivalence) adds a non‑judgmental way to talk about alcohol as an illness while still emphasizing the person’s freedom and responsibility to choose recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy (a structured therapy that links situations, thoughts, feelings, and behaviors) adds tools for identifying beliefs like “I’m just weak” or “It’s all my fault,” understanding how these beliefs arise from the illness, and replacing them with more accurate, helpful thoughts that support change.​",
2,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,The doctor's theory that we have an allergy to al- cohol interests us.,it explains many things for which we cannot otherwise account.,"Some people react to alcohol differently: once they begin, craving and loss of control follow.","Clinically, the “allergy” idea becomes a way of explaining that certain individuals have a strong, learned and biological response to alcohol such that one drink often triggers escalating use. Motivational interviewing helps people explore what this pattern means for them (“When you look at how ‘one’ usually goes for you, what feels like the safest plan?”), guiding them toward their own conclusion about whether abstinence is necessary. Cognitive behavioral therapy focuses on the thoughts and situations that precede the “first drink” (for example, “I can handle it this time,” “I deserve a break”) and teaches people to notice, question, and change those thoughts, practicing alternative responses in high‑risk situations so they can avoid starting the cycle.​",
3,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,"Though we work out our solutions on the spiritual as well as an altruistic plane, we favor hospitalization for the alcoholic who is very jittery or befogged.",he has then a bet- ter chance of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.,Detoxification and stabilization often need to come before deeper psychological or spiritual work.,"Today this is called medically managed withdrawal: acute intoxication and withdrawal symptoms are treated so that concentration, memory, and decision‑making can return. Motivational interviewing supports this phase by focusing on safety and the person’s own goals (“What would you hope life looks like after you get through this?”), helping them accept needed medical care without feeling coerced. Cognitive behavioral therapy, once the person is more stable, starts with basic psychoeducation and simple coping tools (like identifying triggers or practicing brief relaxation), gradually adding more complex skills as thinking clears, rather than attempting deep cognitive work while the person is still physically and neurologically compromised.​",
4,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,The doctor writes: The subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount importance,we are perhaps not well equipped to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic knowledge.,Doctors see that patients need a deeper kind of psychological and values-based help than standard medical advice can offer.,"Modern practice recognizes that detox and brief advice are insufficient; people usually need structured psychological therapies and a chance to clarify what kind of life they want without alcohol. Motivational interviewing directly addresses this by teaching clinicians how to have respectful, values‑focused conversations that draw out the person’s own reasons for change instead of just instructing them, bridging the gap the doctor describes. Cognitive behavioral therapy then offers concrete methods to support this “moral psychology”: it helps identify unhelpful beliefs (“Nothing will ever change,” “I am broken”) and behaviors tied to drinking, tests alternative ways of thinking and acting, and builds new habits that align with the person’s values.​",
5,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,Many years ago one of the leading contributors to this book came under our care in this hospital,"They believe in themselves, and still more in the Power which pulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.",An altruistic peer movement—people helping each other without payment—is seen as central to rehabilitation.,"Current approaches view peer and mutual‑help support as powerful because they provide role models, belonging, and practical recovery advice. Motivational interviewing fits naturally with this by respecting the person’s choice about whether and how to use peer groups, and by exploring how hearing others’ recovery stories affects their own hope and motivation (“What, if anything, did you relate to?”). Cognitive behavioral therapy adds structure by helping people analyze what they notice in these groups (for example, specific coping strategies other members use) and plan how to apply similar strategies in their own high‑risk situations, turning inspiration into concrete behavioral experiments.​",
6,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,"Of course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical craving for liquor, and this often requires a definite hospital procedure, before psychological measures can be of maxi- mum benefit.","We feel, after many years if experience, that we have found nothing which has contributed more to the rehabilitation of these men than the altruistic movement now growing up among them.",Detox is one step; ongoing psychological work and peer support are needed for long-term change.,"Modern systems treat detox as the first phase of a longer recovery process that includes therapy, medications when appropriate, and peer involvement. Motivational interviewing is used at each transition (hospital to outpatient, outpatient to community supports) to revisit the person’s own goals and concerns, which increases follow‑through with aftercare plans. Cognitive behavioral therapy after detox systematically teaches trigger identification, craving‑management strategies, and changes in daily routines, and explicitly encourages regular peer contact as a planned part of a relapse‑prevention strategy instead of relying on detox or spiritual experience alone.​",
7,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,Men and women drink essentially because they like the effect produced by alcohol.,"This is repeated over and over, and unless this person can experience an entire psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.","Drinking starts because it feels good and becomes a repeated cycle of craving, brief relief, remorse, and relapse that seems impossible to break without a deep shift.","Today this is described as a reinforcement loop: alcohol first provides pleasure and later relief from tension or withdrawal, training the brain to reach for it automatically in certain situations. Motivational interviewing helps people look clearly at both the short‑term benefits and the long‑term costs of this loop, guiding them toward a personal decision that the costs outweigh the benefits and that a different way of coping is worth trying. Cognitive behavioral therapy supplies concrete tools for that “psychic change” by mapping the chain from trigger to drink to consequences, identifying the thoughts (“I can’t cope without this,” “I deserve it”) and feelings along the way, and rehearsing alternative responses—such as calling someone, leaving a risky situation, or using relaxation—until new, healthier habits begin to form.​",
8,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,On the other hand--and strange as this may seem to those who do not understand--once a psychic change has occurred,the only effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules.,"After a major inner shift in perspective, it feels easier to stay sober if certain basic practices are maintained.","Clinically, many people describe a tipping point at which they no longer see alcohol the same way and feel more hopeful and committed to sobriety, but research shows that this must be supported by ongoing skills and structure. Motivational interviewing can help the person articulate what this shift means (“How do you see alcohol and yourself differently now?”) and connect that new perspective to daily actions they are willing to take to protect their recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy translates the “few simple rules” into an explicit, individualized relapse‑prevention plan—no first drink, avoiding key triggers, attending support meetings, using thought records when craving or resentment appears—so that the inner shift is backed by clear, repeatable behaviors.​",
9,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,Men have cried out to me in sincere and despairing ap- peal: Doctor,"I cannot go on like this!""",Many types do not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.,People often feel utterly hopeless and see that sheer willpower or standard advice has not worked for them.,"Clinically, this describes profound despair after repeated failed attempts to quit, with people feeling beyond help or control. Motivational interviewing is designed for this kind of situation: it avoids arguing or persuading, listens carefully to the pain, and looks for even small signs of desire for change, reflecting these back so the person can begin to hear their own hope and strengths. Cognitive behavioral therapy then treats each “failed attempt” as data, not evidence of worthlessness: together, clinician and client analyze what was happening before the lapse, what thoughts and feelings were present, and what supports were missing, and use that information to design a new, more realistic plan instead of repeating the same pattern.​"
10,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,I do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is entirely a problem of mental control.,These men were not drinking to escape; they were drinking to overcome a crav- ing beyond their mental control.,"Craving can overpower good intentions; drinking is not just a choice to “escape,” but often an attempt to quiet an overwhelming urge.","Modern understanding is that strong craving and conditioned responses can temporarily override self‑control, especially under stress or when exposed to cues. Motivational interviewing acknowledges this reality (“Given how strong the craving was, it makes sense that you felt overwhelmed”) while exploring times when the person did manage to ride out urges, helping them see that some influence over cravings is possible under certain conditions. Cognitive behavioral therapy teaches specific craving‑management strategies—such as delaying use, changing environment, distracting with an absorbing task, and challenging thoughts like “I can’t stand this”—and encourages people to practice these skills regularly when cravings are moderate, so they have more tools available when urges are intense.​",
11,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,There are many situations which arise out of the phenom- enon of craving which cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather then continue to fight.,"The classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much detail is outside the scope of this book.",Craving and its consequences can create such despair that some people would rather die than keep struggling.,"Today this is understood as a serious suicide and self‑harm risk in alcohol use disorder: craving, repeated losses, and shame can create a sense of unbearable, unending suffering. Motivational interviewing emphasizes empathy and safety, inviting honest discussion of suicidal thoughts without judgment and gently exploring whether any part of the person still hopes for a different future, even a small one. Cognitive behavioral therapy adds structured suicide‑focused work: identifying thoughts (“It will never get better”), images, and situations that drive suicidal urges; developing safety plans and coping steps; and practicing alternative actions—like calling a support person or using coping strategies—before acting on the urge, so there are practical ways to “continue to fight” besides enduring alone.​",
12,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,"There are, of course, the psychopaths who are emotionally unstable.","They are often able, intelligent, friendly people.","Alcoholism appears in many psychological “types,” including people who are outwardly successful but emotionally unstable, yet all share a common vulnerability once they drink.","Modern language would emphasize that people with alcohol use disorder vary widely: some have marked mood or personality difficulties, others appear high‑functioning, but they share a tendency to lose control once they start drinking. Motivational interviewing avoids stigmatizing labels by focusing on each person’s unique story and goals, asking what kind of life they want rather than defining them by a diagnosis or stereotype, and partnering with them on change. Cognitive behavioral therapy allows individualized case formulations: for those with emotional instability, work may focus on managing intense emotions and impulsive reactions; for high‑functioning individuals, it may address perfectionism, denial, or overconfidence that masks risk, all while keeping the shared mechanism—loss of control after the first drink—central in treatment planning.​",
13,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,"All these, and many others, have one symptom in com- mon: they cannot start drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving.",The only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence.,"Whatever their psychological differences, once they start drinking, craving and loss of control reliably follow; total abstinence is recommended.","Clinically, this means that for people with severe alcohol use disorder, any amount of alcohol greatly increases the chance of escalating use, so a “no first drink” rule is usually the safest long‑term goal. Motivational interviewing is crucial when discussing abstinence because many people still hope for controlled drinking; it helps them compare their actual experience of “just one” with their goals and supports them in deciding for themselves whether abstinence fits their pattern. Cognitive behavioral therapy then supports an abstinence goal by identifying situations and thoughts that lead to that first drink, challenging rationalizations (“One won’t hurt,” “I can start tomorrow”), and rehearsing alternative behaviors—such as leaving events early, refusing drinks assertively, or arranging alcohol‑free activities—until abstinence becomes a lived pattern rather than just an idea.​",
14,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,This immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate.,"among physicians, the general opinion seems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed.",Abstinence recommendations and historical medical pessimism about “chronic alcoholics” created controversy and hopelessness.,"Modern evidence shows that many people with severe alcohol use disorder do recover, often after multiple attempts and with ongoing support, even though risk remains elevated. Motivational interviewing deliberately avoids doom‑laden predictions and instead emphasizes personal choice and realistic hope, asking questions like “What kind of future would you like to move toward, even if the road is hard?” to shift attention from being “doomed” to considering meaningful change. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps counter hopeless beliefs (“I am doomed,” “Nothing works for me”) by examining real‑life examples of coping and improvement, however small, and by breaking large, intimidating goals into smaller, achievable steps that can gradually provide evidence against the sense of inevitability.​",
15,Front matter,The Doctor's Opinion,What is the solution? Perhaps I can best answer this by relating one of my experiences.,A long time has passed with no return to alcohol.,The doctor presents a detailed success story: someone moved from hopelessness to long-term sobriety by following the outlined plan.,"Clinically, such stories are used to build hope and illustrate pathways to change—medical stabilization, acceptance of help, engagement with a program, and sustained practice leading to long‑term sobriety. Motivational interviewing makes use of these narratives by asking the listener what feels similar or different from their own situation and what, if anything, they might want to try from the example, so the story becomes personally meaningful rather than just inspirational. Cognitive behavioral therapy extends the value of the story by breaking it into specific, observable steps (seeking help, avoiding certain triggers, practicing honesty, connecting with others) and helping the person choose a few of those steps to apply in their own life, tracking the effects so that the case example becomes a model for practical behavior change rather than a distant ideal.",
31,Main text,Bill's Story,We commenced to make many fast friends and a fellowship has grown up among us of which it is a wonderful thing to feel a part.,"In God's hands, we began to talk freely of Him.",A new social world and sense of belonging grow around shared recovery and spiritual focus.,"Clinically, this describes the emergence of a recovery‑oriented peer network that replaces isolation with connection and shared purpose, which is known to support sustained sobriety and reduce relapse risk. Motivational interviewing would explore how this fellowship matches the person’s own needs for community and support (“What is it like to be around people who understand your struggle?”), strengthening motivation to stay connected. Cognitive behavioral therapy would encourage using this network strategically—for example, scheduling contact with peers before predictable high‑risk times—and would help the person notice and challenge thoughts that discourage connection (“I don’t belong,” “They don’t really care”), reinforcing participation in recovery‑supportive relationships.​",
32,Main text,Bill's Story,My wife and I abandoned ourselves with enthusi- asm to the idea of helping other alcoholics to a solution of their problems.,There is scarcely any form of trouble and misery which has not been overcome among us.,"The couple devotes themselves to helping other alcoholics and sees broad, positive change in many lives.","Clinically, this highlights the role of service and peer support: actively helping others with similar problems can strengthen one’s own recovery by providing meaning, accountability, and a reminder of where one came from. Motivational interviewing would help a person explore how helping others fits with their values (“What does it mean to you to use your experience to benefit someone else?”) and what forms of service feel sustainable at their current stage of recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy integrates service into relapse‑prevention by identifying specific, realistic helping behaviors (sharing their story, outreach, sponsorship), addressing anxious or self‑critical thoughts about these roles (“I have nothing to offer”), and noting how such actions improve mood, reduce isolation, and reinforce reasons to stay sober.​",
33,Main text,There Is a Solution,"WE, OF ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, know thousands of men and women who were once just as hopeless as Bill.",This is the great news this book carries to those who suffer from alcoholism.,The message shifts from a single story to a common solution shared by thousands who were once hopeless.,"Clinically, this conveys universality and hope: many people with severe alcohol use disorder, not just one, have recovered, which can counter the belief “no one like me gets better.” Motivational interviewing can amplify this by asking how hearing about “thousands” affects the person’s sense of what is possible for them (“Does this change how you view your chances at all?”), inviting new hope without pressure. Cognitive behavioral therapy uses this information to challenge global hopeless thoughts (“I’m a special case; nothing works for me”) and to justify trying structured change strategies (meetings, coping skills, planning), since others with similar severity have benefited from them.​",
34,Main text,There Is a Solution,An illness of this sort--and we have come to believe it an illness--involves those about us in a way no other human sickness can.,"We hope this volume will inform and comfort those who are, or who may be affected.","Alcoholism is framed as an illness that deeply affects family and others, and the book is offered as information and comfort to them as well as to the drinker.","Modern practice emphasizes that alcohol use disorder is a family disease: partners, children, and others experience stress, trauma, and role changes, and they also need information and support. Motivational interviewing can be used with both individuals and families to explore their experiences, needs, and hopes (“How has alcohol affected your family?” “What would you like to be different?”), fostering collaborative change goals rather than blame. Cognitive behavioral therapy with families can map interaction patterns (for example, arguments, enabling, withdrawal), teach communication and problem‑solving skills, and help family members challenge beliefs like “If I just try harder, I can control their drinking,” leading to healthier boundaries and a more supportive environment for recovery.​",
35,Main text,There Is a Solution,We are average Americans.,"But we are convinced that to an alcoholic, such as we have known him, the world is not the same as it once was.","The speakers identify as ordinary people but insist that, for alcoholics, the world feels fundamentally altered by the illness.","Clinically, this acknowledges that while people with alcohol use disorder may look “normal” on the outside, their internal experience of craving, guilt, and fear changes how they perceive everyday life. Motivational interviewing invites people to describe this altered experience in their own words (“How does the world look different to you when you’re drinking or trying not to drink?”), which can deepen self‑understanding and motivation for change. Cognitive behavioral therapy can then work directly with the beliefs and perceptions that have shifted (“The world is dangerous,” “Everyone is judging me”), examining their accuracy and impact on behavior, and building more balanced appraisals that support healthier coping and social engagement.​",
36,Main text,There Is a Solution,There is a solution.,Time out of mind men have searched their own minds or the minds of others to find the solution to their alcoholic problem.,The text insists there is a way out and notes that people have long sought solutions in various ways.,"Clinically, this reinforces hope while recognizing that many attempts—thinking harder, willpower, advice—have not worked, suggesting that a different approach is needed. Motivational interviewing uses this contrast by exploring what the person has already tried, what they hoped those efforts would do, and what they want to be different this time, helping them move toward considering new strategies like structured therapy and support. Cognitive behavioral therapy offers a specific kind of “different approach” by shifting from vague introspection (“searching the mind”) to systematic functional analysis and skills training, helping people see concrete links between situations, thoughts, feelings, and drinking, and then practice alternative responses that did not exist in previous attempts.​",
37,Main text,There Is a Solution,"We have, in the main, approached alcoholism as an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.",We feel that elimination of our drinking is but a beginning.,Alcoholism is approached as an illness that requires a spiritual experience; stopping drinking is seen as only the first step in a larger transformation.,"Modern interpretations often translate “spiritual experience” into a deep shift in values, meaning, and identity, alongside behavioral and emotional change. Motivational interviewing can explore what “more than just not drinking” means to the person (“Beyond stopping alcohol, what kind of life do you want?”), anchoring motivation in broader life change rather than mere abstinence. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports the idea that elimination of drinking is a beginning by continuing work after initial abstinence on mood, relationships, and life roles—addressing underlying beliefs and skills deficits so that the broader transformation (for example, becoming more honest, responsible, and connected) can develop and support long‑term recovery.​",
38,Main text,There Is a Solution,We are convinced that a spiritual mode of living is a most powerful health restorative.,Our more religious members call it “God-consciousness.”,"A spiritual way of life is described as a powerful restorer of health, sometimes called “God-consciousness.”","Clinically, this points to the importance of meaning, purpose, and a sense of connection to something larger than oneself—factors associated with better mental health and recovery outcomes. Motivational interviewing respects diverse beliefs by asking what, if any, spiritual or meaning‑based ideas feel helpful to the person, and how those ideas might support their health and recovery (“What gives your life a sense of purpose?”), rather than imposing a particular theology. Cognitive behavioral therapy can complement this by helping clients identify and strengthen supportive beliefs (for example, “My life has value,” “I am part of something bigger”) and by challenging harsh, punitive spiritual interpretations (“I’m being punished,” “I’m beyond forgiveness”) that increase shame and relapse risk, steering toward more compassionate, health‑promoting perspectives.​",
39,Main text,There Is a Solution,The tremendous fact for every one of us is that we have discovered a common solution.,"But we saw that it really worked in others, and we had come to believe in the hopelessness and futility of life as we had been living it.",The key point is that people who saw their lives as hopeless discovered a shared solution by observing it working in others and accepting their own futility.,"Clinically, this describes identification (“They’re like me”) and social proof (“It worked for them”), which are powerful factors in changing beliefs about what is possible. Motivational interviewing leverages this by asking how seeing others recover influences the person’s beliefs about their own situation (“If it worked for people who felt as hopeless as you, what does that suggest?”), gently shifting from resignation to openness. Cognitive behavioral therapy uses this new information to challenge global beliefs of futility (“Nothing can help”) and to justify experimenting with the “common solution”—such as attending groups and using coping skills—as behavioral tests of a new, more hopeful hypothesis about their ability to change.​",
40,Main text,There Is a Solution,We had a new Employer.,"We became less and less interested in ourselves, our little plans and designs.","A shift is described from self‑directed life (“our little plans”) to seeing a higher power as the “employer,” leading to reduced self‑centeredness.","Modern clinical language would say that the person moves from a self‑centered, control‑focused lifestyle to one guided by chosen higher principles or values, reducing obsession with self and increasing focus on contribution and connection. Motivational interviewing can help clients define what “new employer” or guiding principle means to them personally (for example, family, service, faith, integrity) and explore how living under that “employment” changes their decisions about alcohol and daily conduct. Cognitive behavioral therapy operationalizes this shift by helping clients translate their chosen guiding principles into specific behaviors (for example, showing up reliably, being honest, helping others) and by examining self‑centered thoughts (“I have to get my way,” “My plans are all that matter”) when they arise, replacing them with more balanced, value‑consistent thinking that supports sobriety.​",
41,Main text,There Is a Solution,"As we felt new power flow in, as we enjoyed peace of mind, as we discovered we could face life successfully,",We were reborn.,"The narrative describes an experience of new strength, peace, and competence in facing life, summed up as being “reborn.”","Clinically, this reflects improvements in self‑efficacy (confidence in handling life), emotional stability, and identity, which often emerge as people maintain sobriety and practice new skills and values. Motivational interviewing would highlight and reinforce these gains (“What are you handling differently now?”), helping the person link them to their efforts and choices rather than attributing change only to external forces, which can strengthen commitment to continued recovery behaviors. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help consolidate this “rebirth” by identifying specific thoughts and actions that contributed to the improved state (for example, asking for help, using coping skills, maintaining routines) and by planning to continue and expand those habits, while also preparing for inevitable future stressors so that confidence does not collapse at the first setback.​",
42,Main text,There Is a Solution,Most of us sense that real tolerance of other people's shortcomings and viewpoints and a respect for their opinions are attitudes which make us more useful to others.,"We have begun to learn tolerance, patience and good will toward all men, even our enemies, for we look on them as sick people.","Learning tolerance, patience, and goodwill toward others—including those who have harmed us—is presented as part of the new way of living.","Clinically, this involves cognitive and emotional shifts in how others are viewed (from enemies to “sick people”) and in how one responds to perceived wrongs, which can reduce anger and resentment that otherwise trigger craving and relapse. Motivational interviewing might explore the person’s own reasons for wanting to be more tolerant (“How does it feel when you let go of some of that anger?”) and how this change connects with their values and sobriety goals. Cognitive behavioral therapy provides structured work on resentment and interpersonal triggers: identifying anger‑provoking thoughts (“They did this on purpose”), evaluating their accuracy, and experimenting with alternative interpretations and responses (such as setting boundaries or practicing empathy), which can lower emotional arousal and reduce risk of drinking in response to interpersonal stress.​",
43,Main text,There Is a Solution,"An occasional good performance by us, that feeling of being “on the beam,”","We have tried hard to hold the path, but have failed.",The text contrasts occasional good behavior and feeling “on the beam” with a history of repeated failure to maintain that state by self‑effort alone.,"Clinically, this captures the familiar pattern of brief improvements followed by relapse into old behavior, leading to frustration and discouragement. Motivational interviewing would invite the person to look at what was happening during times they felt “on the beam” (what they were doing differently, what support they had) and what changed before each return to old patterns, fostering insight without blame. Cognitive behavioral therapy then uses this information to identify maintaining conditions for improvement (for example, routine, connection, coping skills) and risk factors for deterioration (fatigue, isolation, certain thoughts like “I’ve got this now”), helping design a maintenance plan that makes helpful behaviors more consistent rather than sporadic.​",
44,Main text,There Is a Solution,We have found much of heaven and we have been rocketed into a fourth dimension of existence of which we had not even dreamed.,"The great fact is just this, and nothing less: That we have had deep and effective spiritual experiences which have revolutionized our whole attitude toward life, toward our fellows and toward God's universe.","A profound spiritual or existential change is described as revolutionizing attitudes toward self, others, and the world.","Clinically, this corresponds to transformative shifts in worldview and identity: people report seeing themselves, relationships, and life’s meaning in a fundamentally new, more hopeful and connected way. Motivational interviewing acknowledges and supports such experiences while helping the person articulate how this new outlook translates into specific ongoing choices (“Given how you see things now, what are you moved to do differently day to day?”), which anchors the change in behavior. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help integrate this transformation by aligning daily thoughts and actions with the new attitudes (for example, replacing old cynical or hostile thinking with more trusting, collaborative perspectives) and by preparing the person for periods when the intensity of the experience fades, so they can continue to live out their new values even when feelings are less dramatic.​",
45,Main text,There Is a Solution,"If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no middle-of-the-road solution.",It demands rigorous honesty.,"The authors state that for serious alcoholics, there is no middle‑of‑the‑road solution; rigorous honesty and full measures are required.","Clinically, this reflects the idea that for people with severe alcohol use disorder, half‑measures—such as partial cutting down or hiding use—tend not to work and that sustained recovery demands clear, honest engagement with change. Motivational interviewing supports this by exploring the person’s own experience with “middle‑of‑the‑road” attempts (for example, controlled drinking, secret use) and inviting them to draw their own conclusions about what level of commitment and honesty is needed for them. Cognitive behavioral therapy operationalizes “rigorous honesty” by encouraging truthful self‑monitoring of urges, use, and high‑risk situations, including when lapses occur, and by addressing thoughts that promote dishonesty (“If I admit this, I’ll be rejected”), so that honest reporting becomes a skill that protects recovery instead of a threat to it.",
16,Main text,Bill's Story,"My brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness and that of my mother I was placed in a na- tionally-known hospital",Surely this was the answer--self-knowledge.,"Hospitalization, physical rehabilitation, and self-knowledge are tried as a solution but do not prevent later relapse.","In modern terms this describes acute treatment and insight-oriented work that improve short-term functioning but do not by themselves change the patterns that drive alcohol use. Motivational interviewing (a collaborative counseling style that explores a person’s mixed feelings about change) would add structured conversations about what the hospital stay and new self-knowledge actually mean for the person’s goals, rather than assuming insight alone will keep them sober. Cognitive behavioral therapy (a structured therapy that links situations, thoughts, emotions, and behaviors) would then focus on identifying the specific triggers, beliefs, and habits that continue after discharge (“I’ll be different this time,” “I can handle one drink”) and teach concrete coping skills so that self‑knowledge is translated into different actions in high‑risk situations.​",
17,Main text,Bill's Story,"But it was not, for the frightful day came when I drank once more.",We would soon have to give me over to the undertaker or the asylum.,Relapse occurs despite strong fear and knowledge; the illness is seen as progressive and potentially fatal.,"Today this would be recognized as a relapse after treatment, illustrating that alcohol use disorder is chronic and that fear and insight are not enough to maintain change. Motivational interviewing would explicitly explore this relapse without blame, asking what happened and what the person now wants, and reinforcing that a return to drinking is information about what support and skills are still needed, not proof they are hopeless. Cognitive behavioral therapy would treat this event as a case study, mapping the chain of events, thoughts (“Maybe one won’t hurt”), emotions (fear, shame), and behaviors that led back to drinking, then designing a relapse-prevention plan that addresses each link with alternative responses and support in future similar situations.​",
18,Main text,Bill's Story,No words can tell of the loneliness and despair I found in that bitter morass of self-pity.,How dark it is before the dawn!,"Profound loneliness, self‑pity, and despair lead to a sense of complete defeat that precedes openness to a new solution.","Clinically, this describes a severe depressive and hopeless state often seen in advanced alcohol use disorder, where the person feels isolated, worthless, and unable to imagine improvement. Motivational interviewing responds to such despair with empathy and careful listening, looking for even small expressions of desire or concern (“I can’t go on like this”) and helping the person see these as seeds of motivation rather than signs of failure. Cognitive behavioral therapy would work with the hopeless thinking (“Nothing will ever change,” “I am beyond help”) by gently testing these beliefs against experience, identifying exceptions (times when the person did cope or accept help), and building small, achievable goals that can gradually create evidence that life can improve, helping to move from “darkness” toward “dawn.”​",
19,Main text,Bill's Story,My wife became deeply affected.,She wept when I did not.,"Family members are deeply affected; the alcoholic sees the emotional damage but still cannot control drinking, increasing guilt and strain.","Today this would be framed as the systemic impact of alcohol use disorder—spouses and family members experience fear, sadness, and exhaustion, while the drinker feels guilt and shame yet remains trapped in the pattern. Motivational interviewing can be used with the drinker to explore how their values (for example, wanting to be a loving partner) clash with the effects of their drinking, helping build discrepancy in a non‑attacking way that can strengthen motivation to accept help. Cognitive behavioral therapy often involves family where appropriate, helping all parties understand the cycle (use → conflict → guilt → more use), teaching communication skills, and challenging beliefs like “I’ve already ruined everything” that keep the person stuck, while also building specific plans to protect family members and create a more supportive home environment for recovery.​",
20,Main text,Bill's Story,An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale.,"So two bottles, and-- oblivion.","Alcohol is used to quell withdrawal and mental agony, temporarily quieting both physical symptoms and terrifying thoughts.","Clinically, this illustrates negative reinforcement: drinking removes or reduces unbearable physical and psychological distress, which trains the brain to see alcohol as the only available relief. Motivational interviewing would acknowledge that, given what the person knew at the time, drinking seemed like the only way to survive those mornings, then explore what other forms of relief they might be willing to try if safe alternatives (like medications and support) were offered. Cognitive behavioral therapy would map this “morning terror → drink → relief” loop and introduce replacement strategies—such as prescribed withdrawal medication, relaxation techniques, and calling a support person—that can be practiced in advance and used when the distress spikes, gradually weakening the association between unbearable feelings and automatic drinking.​",
21,Main text,Bill's Story,"My brother-in-law is a physician, and through his kindness and that of my mother I was placed in a na- tionally-known hospital for the mental and physical rehabilitation of alcoholics.",This time I meant business.,A second structured attempt at treatment is made; the person is again sincere and determined to quit.,"In modern practice, repeated treatment episodes are common and can be seen as part of a learning process rather than simple repetition. Motivational interviewing helps surface both the hope (“This time I mean it”) and the fear (“I’ve failed before”) and supports the person in setting realistic, personally meaningful goals for this treatment episode, including what they want to do differently from past attempts. Cognitive behavioral therapy uses the history of prior treatment to tailor the current plan: for example, if previous stays focused mostly on detox, this time the plan might include more work on coping skills, high‑risk situations, and follow‑up supports, so that determination is backed by specific behavioral strategies rather than willpower alone.​",
22,Main text,Bill's Story,"But my friend sat before me, and he made the point- blank declaration that God had done for him what he could not do for himself.",He shouted great tidings.,"A recovered peer claims that a power beyond his own will did what his self‑effort could not, offering a model of hope and a different way of understanding change.","In contemporary terms, this can be seen as a powerful peer testimonial: someone similar to the person describes moving from failure to sustained sobriety with the help of something larger than self‑will, whether understood as spirituality, community, or deeply held values. Motivational interviewing makes use of such stories by asking the listener what stands out and whether anything in the peer’s experience feels relevant to their own struggle, allowing the person to explore the meaning of “something beyond willpower” without imposing a specific belief system. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help translate this into practical terms by identifying which specific behaviors accompanied this shift (for example, attending meetings, asking others for help, avoiding certain places) and helping the client experiment with similar behaviors, while also examining any unhelpful thoughts that might block them (“I shouldn’t need help,” “If I can’t do it myself, I’m weak”).​",
23,Main text,Bill's Story,"My friend suggested what then seemed a novel idea. He said, WHY DON'T YOU CHOOSE YOUR OWN CONCEPTION OF GOD?""""",Upon a foundation of complete willingness I might build what I saw in my friend.,"The person is invited to form a personal, flexible understanding of a higher power and to begin with willingness rather than rigid doctrine.","Clinically, this reflects an individualized approach to spirituality or meaning-making: instead of being told what to believe, the person is encouraged to adopt a personally acceptable concept that can support hope and change. Motivational interviewing aligns closely with this by emphasizing autonomy and choice, asking questions like “What kind of larger purpose or guiding principle, if any, feels helpful to you right now?” and supporting the client’s chosen direction rather than prescribing one. Cognitive behavioral therapy can work alongside this by exploring how certain rigid or hostile beliefs (“Any higher power is nonsense,” “I’m being punished”) might intensify guilt or hopelessness, and by helping the client experiment with more flexible, supportive beliefs—whether spiritual or secular—that are consistent with their values and that reduce relapse‑related shame and self‑attack.​",
24,Main text,Bill's Story,Thus was I convinced that God is concerned with us humans when we want Him enough.,How blind I had been.,"A powerful experience leads to a conviction that a caring power is personally involved, and prior disbelief is seen as “blindness.”","In modern language, this describes a sudden reframe in which the person shifts from feeling abandoned or alone to feeling supported by a benevolent force or framework, which often reduces despair and increases hope. Motivational interviewing would not argue for or against the person’s new conviction but would explore how this belief affects their motivation and choices (“Since you see things this way now, what are you drawn to do differently about drinking and your life?”), helping them connect the new perspective to concrete behavior change. Cognitive behavioral therapy can support this shift by reinforcing its helpful aspects (for example, reduced self‑condemnation, increased sense of support) while also monitoring for extreme or all‑or‑nothing interpretations (“If I ever feel doubt again, I’m lost”), encouraging balanced thinking that can sustain recovery through inevitable emotional ups and downs.​",
25,Main text,Bill's Story,"There I humbly offered myself to God, as I then understood Him, to do with me as He would.",I have not had a drink since.,"A clear decision and act of surrender is made, followed by immediate continuous abstinence in the narrative.","Clinically, this marks a commitment moment: the person decides to stop relying on self‑will alone and to align their actions with a chosen higher principle or purpose, and at least in the story, this is associated with an abrupt end to drinking. Motivational interviewing sees such decisions as the culmination of a process of resolving ambivalence; it would support the person in articulating their commitment clearly (“From today, I’m choosing not to drink and to live by these principles”) and in planning specific steps that express that commitment. Cognitive behavioral therapy emphasizes that even after a powerful decision, cravings and triggers will still appear, so it would help the person build a detailed coping plan—identifying high‑risk situations, rehearsing refusal skills, and setting up supportive routines—so that their decision is backed by practical preparations rather than relying solely on a single moment of resolve.​",
26,Main text,Bill's Story,"My schoolmate visited me, and I fully acquainted him with my problems and deficiencies.",I was to right all such matters to the utmost of my ability.,The person openly shares their problems and defects with another and becomes willing to make amends for past harms as far as possible.,"Clinically, this reflects confession, interpersonal transparency, and a readiness to repair relationships—processes known to reduce shame and improve social support. Motivational interviewing supports this by exploring the person’s own reasons for being honest and making amends (“How would making things right fit with the kind of person you want to be?”), ensuring that these steps are self‑directed rather than coerced. Cognitive behavioral therapy adds structure by helping the person list specific harms, anticipate different possible reactions from others, and practice conversations in advance, as well as by challenging all‑or‑nothing thoughts (“If they don’t forgive me, I’m a failure”) so that the amends process strengthens recovery rather than becoming a new source of overwhelming shame.​",
27,Main text,Bill's Story,I was to test my thinking by the new God-conscious- ness within.,But that would be in great measure.,"Ongoing guidance is framed as comparing one’s thoughts and plans to a new inner sense of God-consciousness, rather than acting from old patterns.","In contemporary clinical terms, this resembles a commitment to monitor thoughts and decisions against a new internal standard or value system, instead of automatically following old impulses and beliefs. Motivational interviewing would help the person describe in their own words what this “new standard” looks like (“What does living by this new awareness mean day to day?”) and what kinds of thoughts or actions fit or don’t fit with it, strengthening ownership of the change process. Cognitive behavioral therapy can operationalize this practice by teaching the person to use thought records or brief check‑ins: when a risky idea arises (“Maybe I could just stop in that bar”), they write it down, examine whether it aligns with their new principles and goals, and then deliberately choose a different response, turning the abstract “testing” into a concrete, repeatable skill.​",
28,Main text,Bill's Story,My friend promised when these things were done I would enter upon a new relationship with my Creator;,were the essential requirements.,"Certain attitudes and actions (honesty, willingness, amends, service) are described as essential requirements for a new way of living.","Clinically, this suggests that lasting change is tied not just to stopping alcohol, but to adopting a different set of attitudes and behaviors—such as honesty, humility, and responsibility—that reshape one’s life context. Motivational interviewing would explore which of these “requirements” resonate most with the person’s own values and which feel most challenging, helping prioritize where they are most willing to start and reinforcing steps they have already taken in this direction. Cognitive behavioral therapy would frame these “requirements” as targets for behavior change (for example, practicing small daily acts of honesty, following through on commitments) and work with the thoughts that interfere (“If I admit I’m wrong, I’ll be humiliated”), using experiments in real-life situations to show how the new behaviors support both sobriety and self‑respect.​",
29,Main text,Bill's Story,"Simple, but not easy; a price had to be paid. It meant destruction of self-centeredness.","God comes to most men gradually, but His impact on me was sudden and profound.","The program is said to be simple in outline but hard in execution because it requires giving up self-centered ways; some experience this change gradually, others suddenly.","Modern practice acknowledges that changing deeply ingrained, self‑focused patterns is demanding and that people differ in how quickly their perspective shifts. Motivational interviewing respects this variability by asking how ready the person feels to make specific changes and by normalizing both slow, incremental progress and sudden shifts, rather than implying that one kind of experience is superior. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps with the “not easy” part by breaking the broad goal (“less self‑centered”) into small, observable behaviors—like listening more in conversations, sharing credit, or considering others’ needs when planning—and by working with thoughts that resist these changes (“If I don’t put myself first, I’ll be walked on”), so that the “price” is understood, tested, and gradually accepted rather than demanded in the abstract.​",
30,Main text,Bill's Story,While I lay in the hospital the thought came that there were thousands of hopeless alcoholics who might be glad to have what had been so freely given me.,They in turn might work with others.,"The person realizes that helping other alcoholics could be a central part of their own recovery, creating a chain of mutual aid.","Clinically, this captures what is now called peer support or service: helping others with similar problems often strengthens one’s own recovery by providing purpose, accountability, and connection. Motivational interviewing can nurture this emerging desire to help by exploring how service fits the person’s values (“What does it mean to you to be useful to others who struggle like you did?”) and by helping them choose forms of helping that feel safe and appropriate for their stage of recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy integrates service into relapse‑prevention planning by identifying specific, realistic helping behaviors (such as sharing their story in a group, making outreach calls, or volunteering at meetings), examining any anxious or self‑critical thoughts that arise about these roles, and collecting evidence over time that such actions improve mood, reduce isolation, and remind them of the reasons to stay sober.",
46,Main text,There Is a Solution,"If you are as seriously alcoholic as we were, we believe there is no middle-of-the-road solution.",You may be suffering from an illness which only a spiritual experience will conquer.,"For serious alcoholics, compromise strategies do not work; a full, transformative solution is required.","Clinically, this says that for severe alcohol use disorder, half‑measures like periodic cutting down or switching drinks usually fail, and a deep change in how life is lived is needed. Motivational interviewing invites people to review their own history with “middle‑of‑the‑road” attempts (moderation, rules) and to compare outcomes with their goals, helping them decide whether a more complete change is necessary. Cognitive behavioral therapy then helps translate the idea of a “full” solution into specific behavioral commitments—such as total abstinence, ongoing support, and regular coping‑skills practice—so the transformation is expressed in daily routines rather than just as an abstract ideal.​",
47,Main text,There Is a Solution,"To one who feels as we felt, that we are not truly human unless we can drink, will want to stop drinking so badly that you will be willing to go to any length to do so.",You may feel that nothing can be done about it.,The text acknowledges the belief that life without alcohol feels inhuman and anticipates hopelessness about change.,"Clinically, this reflects a common identity belief (“Drinking is part of who I am”) that makes sobriety seem like a loss of self and fuels hopelessness. Motivational interviewing would explore this belief empathetically, asking what alcohol has meant to the person and what they fear losing, while also inviting them to imagine what they might gain by change (“What parts of you might come back if alcohol were not in charge?”). Cognitive behavioral therapy works directly with identity‑related thoughts by examining evidence for and against ideas like “I’m not myself without alcohol” and by encouraging experiments in sober activities that express the person’s real interests and values, gradually showing that a meaningful, “human” life is possible without drinking.​",
48,Main text,More About Alcoholism,MOST OF US have been unwilling to admit we were real alcoholics.,"The idea that somehow, someday he will control and enjoy his drinking is the great obsession of every abnormal drinker.",Denial of being a “real alcoholic” and obsession with one day controlling drinking are presented as central features of the condition.,"Clinically, this describes minimization and persistent hope for controlled use despite contrary evidence—core elements of denial in alcohol use disorder. Motivational interviewing is specifically designed to work with this ambivalence by exploring the pros and cons of continued attempts at control and gently asking how past efforts compare with what the person hoped would happen, so they can reconsider their stance without confrontation. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps the person examine the “great obsession” as a belief (“Someday I’ll manage it”) by looking at real outcomes of past attempts, challenging thinking errors (“This time will be different for no good reason”), and supporting a shift toward goals that fit the actual pattern, often an abstinence focus for severe cases.​",
49,Main text,More About Alcoholism,We learned that we had to fully concede to our innermost selves that we were alcoholics.,This is the first step in recovery.,Fully conceding to oneself that one is alcoholic is framed as essential and as the first step in recovery.,"Clinically, this is about accurate self‑diagnosis and acceptance: acknowledging the severity and pattern of alcohol problems without minimizing. Motivational interviewing supports this “innermost” concession by helping people hear themselves describe their use, consequences, and failed control attempts, then reflecting back patterns they identify, so recognition arises from their own narrative rather than from being labeled. Cognitive behavioral therapy reinforces acceptance by reviewing concrete evidence (frequency, quantities, consequences) and linking it to diagnostic criteria, while also working with shame and self‑stigma (“If I admit this, I’m worthless”) so that acceptance becomes a starting point for problem‑solving, not a reason for despair.​",
50,Main text,More About Alcoholism,We alcoholics are men and women who have lost the ability to control our drinking.,We know that no real alcoholic ever recovers control.,"Loss of control is defined as a hallmark of alcoholism, and regaining control is said not to happen for “real” alcoholics.","Clinically, this recognizes impaired control as a defining feature of severe alcohol use disorder: repeated failures to limit use despite strong intentions. Motivational interviewing can ask people to describe specific episodes when they intended to control their drinking and what actually happened, fostering insight into their control patterns without accusation. Cognitive behavioral therapy integrates this insight into a relapse‑prevention framework: if control efforts consistently fail, the plan shifts from moderation to complete abstinence, with skills focused on avoiding the first drink and managing triggers, rather than on trying to stop mid‑episode.​",
51,Main text,More About Alcoholism,"The fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink.",Our so-called will power becomes practically nonexistent.,The text states that most alcoholics have lost the power of choice regarding alcohol and that willpower becomes nearly useless in this area.,"Modern formulations mirror this by describing how neuroadaptations and conditioned learning greatly weaken voluntary control over drinking in severe cases, especially once alcohol is present in the system. Motivational interviewing affirms the person’s experience (“It sounds like your drinking sometimes takes over despite your plans”) and shifts the focus from “trying harder” to “trying differently,” exploring options that do not rely solely on willpower (support, skills, environment changes). Cognitive behavioral therapy directly targets the idea of “no choice” by identifying where choice still exists: before exposure to key triggers, in how the person structures their day, and in which coping responses they practice, thereby building a sense of influence and specific strategies that do not depend on raw willpower in the moment of maximum craving.​",
52,Main text,More About Alcoholism,"We are unable, at certain times, to bring into our consciousness with sufficient force the memory of the suffering and humiliation of even a week or a month ago.",We are without defense against the first drink.,The inability to recall past suffering with enough impact to prevent drinking is given as the reason for being defenseless against the first drink at certain times.,"Clinically, this points to state‑dependent memory and cognitive biases: in craving states, the brain prioritizes anticipated relief or pleasure over remembered pain, weakening natural deterrents. Motivational interviewing might explore with clients how their thinking about alcohol changes between calm moments and high‑craving moments, helping them see why relying on memory of consequences alone is not enough and strengthening motivation to build external supports and plans. Cognitive behavioral therapy addresses this by developing external cues (written plans, reminders, support calls) and specific coping scripts for high‑risk times, so that when memory of suffering is weak, pre‑planned behaviors and prompts can still interrupt the move toward the first drink.​",
53,Main text,More About Alcoholism,Once more: The alcoholic at certain times has no effective mental defense against the first drink.,His defense must come from a Higher Power.,The text reiterates that the alcoholic lacks a reliable mental defense against the first drink and asserts that defense must come from a higher power.,"Clinically, this acknowledges the limits of purely cognitive strategies in the heat of craving and proposes reliance on something beyond solitary reasoning—whether understood as spirituality, community, or deeply held values. Motivational interviewing would explore what “higher power” or greater support means personally to the client (for example, a recovery group, a sense of purpose, faith), and how turning to that resource could look in concrete terms when they are nearing a first drink. Cognitive behavioral therapy translates “defense from a higher power” into observable behaviors: calling a sponsor or trusted person, going to a meeting, reviewing a values statement, or using pre‑planned coping skills; while these may be spiritually framed, they function as behavioral defenses that do not rely solely on momentary thought power.​",
54,Main text,We Agnostics,IN THE PRECEDING chapters you have learned something of alcoholism.,These are questions which arise in the minds of multitudes of people.,"The chapter introduces the spiritual question, acknowledging that many doubt or reject traditional religious ideas and have questions about God.","Clinically, this recognizes that spiritual or religious language can be a barrier for many, and that doubts about God or religion are common and need to be addressed respectfully rather than brushed aside. Motivational interviewing is well‑suited here, as it emphasizes honoring the person’s current beliefs and exploring their questions and concerns without pushing a particular view, focusing instead on how any larger sense of meaning or connection might support their recovery. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help clients examine rigid or all‑or‑nothing beliefs about spirituality (“If I don’t accept a specific doctrine, nothing spiritual is possible”) and consider more flexible, personally meaningful ways of thinking about purpose, connection, or “something bigger” that do not conflict with their intellect or past experiences.​",
55,Main text,We Agnostics,"We found that as soon as we were able to lay aside prejudice and express even a willingness to believe in a Power greater than ourselves, we commenced to get results.",We found that God does not make too hard terms with those who seek Him.,Setting aside prejudice and being willing to consider a power greater than oneself is described as opening the way to positive results.,"Clinically, this is about cognitive openness: letting go of rigid, negative preconceptions and experimenting with new beliefs or frameworks that might support change. Motivational interviewing emphasizes willingness as a starting point (“You don’t have to be convinced; what would it be like just to be open to the possibility that something beyond you could help?”), inviting exploration rather than demanding belief. Cognitive behavioral therapy can treat spiritual willingness like any other cognitive experiment: the client might act “as if” for a period (for example, engaging in a practice or community aligned with a higher‑power concept) and then review what happens, allowing experience to inform beliefs instead of letting prejudice or fear dictate them in advance.​",
56,Main text,We Agnostics,"Much to our relief, we discovered we did not need to consider another's conception of God.","Our own conception, however inadequate, was sufficient to make the approach and to effect a contact with Him.","The text states that one does not need to adopt others’ conceptions of God; one’s own, however limited, is enough to begin.","Clinically, this promotes autonomy and personalization in the realm of meaning and spirituality: people can define for themselves what “higher power” or guiding principle means in a way that feels safe and acceptable. Motivational interviewing embraces this stance by asking what kind of greater purpose or guiding force, if any, the person might be willing to consider and how that fits their background and values, avoiding pressure to conform to others’ definitions. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports this by helping individuals articulate their own conception in clear, practical terms and examining how that belief influences their coping (for example, feeling supported vs. condemned), while challenging self‑attacking or rigid spiritual beliefs that hinder recovery.​",
57,Main text,We Agnostics,When we drew near to Him He disclosed Himself to us!,In this respect alcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a state of reasonableness.,The text describes a process where suffering from alcohol breaks down resistance and leads people to become more open (“reasonable”) about spiritual ideas.,"Clinically, this reflects how repeated negative consequences can soften rigid defenses and increase openness to new perspectives or methods, including those once rejected. Motivational interviewing recognizes that hitting “bottoms” can increase readiness, but it seeks to use current pain constructively rather than waiting for worse consequences, exploring how existing suffering already suggests the need for change and openness to new solutions. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help transform this “persuasion by alcohol” into structured learning: reviewing how previous stubborn adherence to certain beliefs (“I don’t need help,” “All spirituality is nonsense”) has led to worse outcomes, and experimenting with more flexible, “reasonable” beliefs and actions that may lead to improved functioning and well‑being.​",
58,Main text,How It Works,RARELY HAVE we seen a person fail who has thoroughly followed our path.,Those who do not recover are people who cannot or will not completely give themselves to this simple program.,"The chapter opens by claiming that those who thoroughly follow the program rarely fail, and suggests that failure is linked to inability or unwillingness to fully commit.","Clinically, this highlights the importance of engagement and adherence: outcomes are better when people actively participate in a structured recovery plan, though barriers to “complete” commitment often include fear, trauma, and competing demands. Motivational interviewing examines both ability and willingness by asking what gets in the way of fuller engagement (“What makes it hard to give yourself to this?”) and what might help, treating reluctance as something to be understood rather than blamed. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps break down “thoroughly following our path” into specific, manageable tasks (attending meetings, doing written work, practicing honesty), identifying obstacles and unhelpful beliefs for each task, and building stepwise goals so that commitment is developed over time instead of assumed to be all‑or‑nothing from the start.​",
59,Main text,How It Works,Half measures availed us nothing.,Until we let go absolutely we could not be successful.,The statement asserts that half‑measures do not work and that success requires complete letting go.,"Clinically, this conveys that partial or inconsistent application of recovery efforts (for example, sometimes honest, sometimes not; sometimes avoiding triggers, sometimes not) often fails, and that more consistent change is needed for stability. Motivational interviewing explores where the person is currently using “half‑measures” (for example, selective truth‑telling, occasional meeting attendance) and what they fear about “letting go absolutely,” inviting a collaborative conversation about what fuller commitment might realistically look like for them. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps translate “no half‑measures” into concrete, trackable behaviors (for example, disclosing all use to a sponsor or therapist, removing all alcohol from the home, following through on agreed coping strategies), while also addressing perfectionistic or fatalistic thoughts (“If I can’t be perfect, it’s not worth trying”) by reframing “letting go” as a direction of travel rather than instant perfection.​",
60,Main text,How It Works,"Remember that we deal with alcohol--cunning, baffling, powerful!",May you find Him now!,"Alcohol is personified as cunning, baffling, and powerful, and the reader is urged to seek a higher power immediately.","Clinically, personifying alcohol underscores the complexity and strength of the addiction, reminding people not to underestimate it or rely on simple willpower; seeking a higher power points to needing support beyond one’s unaided mind. Motivational interviewing would build on this by asking how the person has experienced alcohol as “cunning” or “powerful” in their own life, validating their struggle and opening a discussion about what kinds of additional help—whether spiritual, social, or professional—they feel willing to seek “now.” Cognitive behavioral therapy echoes the caution about underestimating alcohol by focusing on detailed relapse‑prevention work (identifying subtle triggers, early warning signs, and seemingly harmless decisions that lead back to use) and by integrating external supports (sponsors, groups, therapy) as routine parts of defense against relapse, rather than expecting internal resolve alone to handle a powerful, “baffling” condition.",
61,Main text,How It Works,"Being convinced, we were at Step Three, which is that we decided to turn our will and our life over to God as we understood Him.",We were now at Step Three.,Step Three is presented as a decision to turn one’s will and life over to a higher power as understood by the individual.,"Clinically, this can be seen as a commitment to stop managing everything through solitary self‑will and instead to let one’s choices be guided by a chosen set of higher principles, values, or spiritual beliefs. Motivational interviewing would treat this as a decision point: exploring what “turning over” means to the person, what they hope it will change, and what concerns they have, so that the commitment is truly theirs rather than made to please others. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports this step by helping translate “turning over” into specific behaviors—like pausing to reflect before acting, consulting trusted supports, and comparing decisions to stated values—and by working with fears (“If I’m not in control, everything will fall apart”) through thought‑challenging and behavioral experiments.​",
62,Main text,How It Works,"Selfishness—self-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our troubles.",We had to have God's help.,"Selfishness and self‑centeredness are identified as the root of many troubles, with the implication that help beyond oneself is needed to change this pattern.","Clinically, this highlights a pattern where excessive focus on one’s own fears, desires, and resentments drives conflicts, isolation, and ultimately drinking. Motivational interviewing might explore where self‑centered patterns show up (“When you look back, in what ways were you putting your own wants ahead of everything else?”) and how shifting toward more other‑oriented, value‑based living could support sobriety and better relationships. Cognitive behavioral therapy addresses self‑centeredness by identifying self‑focused thoughts (“What about me?” “I’m being cheated”) and examining their accuracy and consequences, then practicing behaviors that intentionally consider others’ needs and perspectives, which can reduce interpersonal stress and associated urges to drink.​",
63,Main text,How It Works,"So our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making.",We had to quit playing God.,The text claims that most troubles are of one’s own making and insists that individuals must stop “playing God” by trying to control everything and everyone.,"Clinically, this speaks to responsibility for one’s choices and to controlling behavior that damages relationships and increases stress, but it can also provoke shame if read as blaming. Motivational interviewing balances ownership and compassion by helping the person identify specific choices that contributed to problems while also acknowledging external factors, then exploring what kind of more humble, collaborative stance toward others fits their values. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps differentiate between realistic responsibility (“I chose to drink after that argument”) and excessive self‑blame (“Everything is my fault”), challenging distortions and supporting specific changes—like reducing attempts to control others and instead focusing on changing one’s own responses—that improve relationships and reduce relapse risk.​",
64,Main text,How It Works,"Next, we decided that hereafter in this drama of life, God was going to be our Director.",We were reborn.,"A new role relationship is described where a higher power is the “Director” and the person is an “agent” or “child,” marking a sense of being “reborn.”","Clinically, this indicates a shift from rigid self‑reliance and control to a more trusting, guided posture in life, which can reduce anxiety and impulsive decision‑making. Motivational interviewing would explore what it means to the person to no longer be the “director” of everything (“What changes for you when you stop trying to run the whole show?”) and how that might support sobriety and emotional stability. Cognitive behavioral therapy can frame this as moving from impulsive, ego‑driven choices to value‑guided decisions: clients learn to pause, check whether an action aligns with their guiding principles, and then choose accordingly, practicing this repeatedly so that the “reborn” identity is reflected in consistent behavior rather than just a feeling.​",
65,Main text,How It Works,We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready that we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.,"This was only a beginning, though if honestly and humbly made, an effect, sometimes a very great one, was felt at once.","The text emphasizes careful consideration before Step Three, framing it as a beginning that can have immediate effects if taken honestly and humbly.","Clinically, this underscores the importance of intentional, reflective commitment and notes that people may feel early benefits, though deeper work lies ahead. Motivational interviewing would slow down here, helping the person weigh the decision thoughtfully (“What would it mean in practice to abandon yourself to this new way?”), and elicit their own arguments for and against making such a commitment now. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports this beginning by setting expectations that even with an initial emotional “lift,” continued work (inventory, amends, coping skills) is needed, and by helping the client notice and reinforce early positive changes, which strengthens motivation to continue when the emotional intensity fades.​",
66,Main text,How It Works,"Next we launched out on a course of vigorous action, the first step of which is a personal housecleaning, which many of us had never attempted.",THIS WAS STEP FOUR.,"Vigorous action is introduced in the form of a searching personal inventory (“housecleaning”), identified as Step Four.","Clinically, this is akin to a structured self‑assessment: identifying patterns of resentment, fear, and harmful behavior that maintain distress and relapse. Motivational interviewing can help prepare for this challenging work by exploring the person’s hopes and fears about looking so closely at themselves (“What might be helpful about doing this inventory? What feels scary?”), reinforcing autonomy and readiness. Cognitive behavioral therapy parallels Step Four by using written inventories and worksheets to identify triggers, beliefs, and behavior patterns; this allows more precise targeting of cognitive distortions and high‑risk situations in subsequent sessions, turning “housecleaning” into an organized treatment plan.​",
67,Main text,How It Works,Resentment is the number one offender. It destroys more alcoholics than anything else.,"We turned back to the list, for it held the key to the future.","Resentment is labeled the primary “offender,” and the inventory list is said to hold the key to change.","Clinically, this stresses that chronic anger and grudges can drive craving, isolation, and relapse, making them crucial treatment targets. Motivational interviewing explores how resentments have affected the person’s drinking and life (“When you stay angry, what tends to happen?”) and whether they are interested in finding ways to lessen the grip of these resentments for their own well‑being. Cognitive behavioral therapy offers clear methods for working with resentment: identifying anger‑provoking thoughts and assumptions, examining their accuracy, considering alternative interpretations, and practicing new responses (assertiveness, boundary‑setting, empathy), thereby reducing emotional arousal and the urge to cope with anger by drinking.​",
68,Main text,How It Works,"We saw that these resentments must be mastered, but how?",We could not wish them away any more than alcohol.,"The text acknowledges that resentments must be mastered and that wishing them away does not work, paralleling the inability to simply wish away alcohol problems.","Clinically, this recognizes that both persistent anger and addiction require active, skill‑based work rather than mere willpower or avoidance. Motivational interviewing would invite the person to consider what they have already tried to handle resentments (ignoring, exploding, ruminating) and how effective those attempts have been, building motivation to try new strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy provides such strategies: writing about resentments, analyzing thinking patterns, practicing forgiveness or acceptance when appropriate, and testing new behaviors in provoking situations, so that “mastery” is built through practice and insight rather than wishing.​",
69,Main text,How It Works,"Referring to our list again. Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had done, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes.",When we saw our faults we listed them.,"The text shifts focus from others’ wrongs to one’s own mistakes and faults, which are listed honestly.","Clinically, this encourages a move from blame to personal responsibility, reducing victim stance and increasing agency, but it must be balanced to avoid excessive self‑blame, especially in trauma histories. Motivational interviewing helps keep this balance by acknowledging real harms from others while also exploring how taking responsibility for one’s part can support recovery and healthier relationships (“What is in your control now?”). Cognitive behavioral therapy uses this shift to refine case formulations: by listing one’s own contributions to conflicts and problems, clients can see where changing their thinking and behavior (for example, reacting less defensively, setting boundaries) may reduce distress and relapse risk, while therapists help guard against unfair self‑criticism.​",
70,Main text,How It Works,"Notice that the word fear is bracketed alongside the difficulties with Mr. Brown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife.",We asked ourselves why we had them.,"Fear is highlighted as underlying many interpersonal difficulties, and the text suggests examining why these fears are present.","Clinically, this identifies fear as a pervasive driver of behavior—prompting defensiveness, withdrawal, or aggression—that complicates relationships and fuels drinking. Motivational interviewing might explore which fears are most powerful for the person (for example, fear of abandonment, failure, or shame) and how alcohol has been used to manage these fears, opening a discussion about alternative ways to cope. Cognitive behavioral therapy addresses fear with structured techniques: identifying fearful thoughts, evaluating how realistic they are, practicing exposure to feared situations in manageable steps, and building coping skills (like problem‑solving or relaxation), so that fear no longer has to be numbed with alcohol.​",
71,Main text,How It Works,"We reviewed our fears thoroughly. We put them on paper, even though we had no resentment in connection with them.","At once, we commence to outgrow fear.","The text recommends a written inventory of fears and suggests that, with a new basis of trust, fear can be outgrown.","Clinically, writing down fears is similar to structured fear assessment and can reduce their vague, overwhelming quality by making them specific and examinable. Motivational interviewing can support this process by affirming the courage it takes to face fears in writing and by asking how reducing certain fears might improve life and support recovery (“If this fear lessened, what would be possible?”). Cognitive behavioral therapy then uses the written list as a foundation for cognitive restructuring and graded exposure: challenging catastrophic predictions, planning small steps into feared situations, and reinforcing successful coping, helping the person gradually “outgrow” fear in a practical, measurable way.​",
72,Main text,How It Works,Now about sex. Many of needed an overhauling there.,We tried to shape a sane and sound ideal for our future sex life.,"The text turns to sex, noting that many people need significant change in this area and suggesting the creation of a “sane and sound” sexual ideal.","Clinically, this highlights that sexual behaviors and beliefs often become distorted during active addiction (for example, secrecy, risk, exploitation) and that addressing this domain is part of comprehensive recovery. Motivational interviewing would approach this sensitive topic gently, inviting the person to describe how alcohol has affected their sexual behavior and relationships and what a healthier, more respectful sexual life would look like for them, consistent with their values. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help by examining beliefs about sex (“I need sex to feel valued,” “If I’m sober, no one will want me”), identifying risky patterns (for example, sex under the influence, using sex to regulate emotion), and planning specific changes and boundaries that support both safety and intimacy in sobriety.​",
73,Main text,How It Works,We subjected each relation to this test: Was it selfish or not?,"In other words, we treat sex as we would any other problem.","Sexual relationships are to be examined through the lens of selfishness versus consideration, and sex is to be treated as any other problem—neither ignored nor obsessed over.","Clinically, this promotes evaluating sexual behavior in terms of mutual respect and responsibility rather than impulse or ego, and normalizing sex as an area for thoughtful problem‑solving rather than taboo or uncontrolled indulgence. Motivational interviewing might ask clients what they want from their sexual and romantic relationships in recovery and how past selfish or impulsive patterns have conflicted with those desires, helping to build motivation for change in this domain. Cognitive behavioral therapy offers tools to treat sex as “any other problem”: clarifying goals, identifying unhelpful thoughts and behaviors, rehearsing assertive communication and consent, and planning responses to high‑risk situations (for example, dating where substances are present), thereby integrating sexual health into the overall relapse‑prevention plan.​",
74,Main text,How It Works,"If we have been thorough about our personal inventory, we have written down a lot.",We have made a good beginning.,"The text notes that a thorough inventory produces substantial written material and frames this as a good beginning, not a complete job.","Clinically, this reinforces that increased self‑awareness—captured in written form—is only the first phase of change; further steps are needed to alter behavior and relationships. Motivational interviewing can help sustain engagement by exploring how it feels to have this “lot” on paper and what the person hopes will change as they move into sharing and amends, emphasizing progress while preparing for the work ahead. Cognitive behavioral therapy uses the inventory as a rich data set for treatment: it guides which beliefs to target, which situations to rehearse, and which relationship patterns to address, making subsequent interventions more precise and personalized rather than generic.​",
75,Main text,How It Works,We have swallowed and digested some big chunks of truth about ourselves.,This brings us to the Fifth Step in the program of recovery mentioned in the preceding chapter.,"Facing and accepting hard truths about oneself leads into Step Five: admitting these truths to God, oneself, and another human being.","Clinically, this moves from private awareness to interpersonal disclosure, which can significantly reduce shame and secrecy—key drivers of continued use. Motivational interviewing prepares for Step Five by exploring the person’s hopes (“What do you think might improve if you shared this with someone safe?”) and fears (“What worries you about being that open?”), supporting an informed, voluntary decision to proceed. Cognitive behavioral therapy underscores the therapeutic value of disclosure by explaining how secrecy maintains distorted self‑views (“If people knew me, they’d reject me”) and by helping select an appropriate person to hear the inventory, role‑playing parts of the conversation to reduce anxiety and increase the likelihood that the experience will be corrective rather than re‑traumatizing.​",
76,Main text,Into Action,"HAVING MADE our personal inventory, what shall we do about it?",We must be entirely honest with somebody if we expect to live long or happily in this world.,"Step Five is introduced as the next action: sharing the inventory honestly with another, presented as necessary for long‑term survival and happiness.","Clinically, this emphasizes that recovery requires at least one deeply honest relationship and that isolation with one’s secrets is dangerous to both sobriety and mental health. Motivational interviewing addresses potential reluctance by eliciting the person’s own reasons for and against telling someone (“What might be the benefits and risks?”) and by affirming that the choice of whom to tell and when remains theirs, which can increase willingness to engage. Cognitive behavioral therapy frames Step Five as an exposure exercise: deliberately facing feared rejection or judgment in a safe setting and gathering new evidence (for example, acceptance, understanding) that challenges catastrophic expectations, thereby weakening shame and the belief that one must drink to cope with hidden guilt.​",
77,Main text,Into Action,"Rightly and naturally, we think well before we choose the person or persons with whom to take this intimate and confidential step.","We pocket our pride and go to it, illuminating every twist of character, every dark cranny of the past.",The text advises careful selection of the person for Step Five and calls for setting aside pride to share honestly and thoroughly.,"Clinically, this underscores the need for safety and trust in disclosure, and for humility in acknowledging one’s full history and patterns. Motivational interviewing can help the client identify people they already trust (sponsor, therapist, clergy) and what qualities make them feel safe, reinforcing their autonomy in the choice and supporting the willingness to move past pride for the sake of healing. Cognitive behavioral therapy helps plan the Step Five session: organizing material, practicing how to say difficult parts, challenging thoughts like “They will think I’m disgusting,” and developing coping strategies for emotional responses during and after the sharing, so the experience is both honest and manageable.​",
78,Main text,Into Action,"Returning home we find a place where we can be quiet for an hour, carefully reviewing what we have done.",We thank God from the bottom of our heart that we know Him better.,"After Step Five, the person is instructed to spend quiet time reflecting on what has been done and to express gratitude for increased understanding of their higher power.","Clinically, this creates a structured debrief period to consolidate the experience, reduce emotional overload, and integrate new insights about self and spirituality. Motivational interviewing would use a subsequent session to debrief as well, asking how the person felt before, during, and after Step Five, what surprised them, and what they see differently now, reinforcing any positive shifts in self‑view or relationship to their higher power. Cognitive behavioral therapy views this quiet review as an opportunity to note changes in beliefs (“Maybe I’m not uniquely bad”), to capture them in writing, and to identify any new unhelpful thoughts that emerged, so they can be addressed in ongoing therapy and aligned with the person’s recovery goals.​",
79,Main text,Into Action,"Now we need more action, without which we find that “Faith without works is dead.”",We have a list of all persons we have harmed and to whom we are willing to make amends.,"Step Eight is introduced: identifying those harmed and becoming willing to make amends, framed as necessary action following faith and inventory.","Clinically, this shifts focus from internal work to repairing external damage, recognizing that unresolved guilt and broken relationships can undermine recovery. Motivational interviewing helps clients explore their feelings about making amends (“What feels important about trying to make things right?” “What scares you?”) and prioritize where willingness already exists versus where more preparation is needed. Cognitive behavioral therapy uses the harm list to examine patterns of behavior, anticipate different responses from those harmed, and develop specific amends plans, including coping strategies for rejection or anger, so that the process reduces guilt and supports sobriety instead of triggering overwhelming shame.​",
80,Main text,Into Action,"We made direct amends to such people wherever possible, except when to do so would injure them or others.","We must not, at any cost, risk our own recovery.","Step Nine calls for direct amends where possible, with the important caveat that they should not cause further harm; the text also implies that protecting one’s recovery is crucial.","Clinically, this guides responsible repair: amends are made thoughtfully, balancing the needs of others with the safety and stability of the person in recovery. Motivational interviewing supports this balance by exploring each potential amends: what the client hopes will come of it, what risks exist, and how it might impact both parties, helping them make informed decisions rather than acting impulsively out of guilt. Cognitive behavioral therapy works through each amends situation in detail, role‑playing conversations, anticipating reactions, and planning backup coping strategies (for example, seeking support immediately afterward), so that the person can engage in meaningful repair without jeopardizing their own sobriety or causing new harm.​",
81,Main text,Into Action,"We are there to sweep off our side of the street, realizing that nothing worthwhile can be accomplished until we do so.",We must not shrink at anything.,The text likens amends to sweeping one’s side of the street and emphasizes not shrinking from difficult but necessary clean‑up.,"Clinically, this reinforces a focus on one’s own responsibilities rather than others’ behavior and encourages courage in facing painful but corrective actions. Motivational interviewing would help clients clarify why “sweeping their side of the street” matters to them—how it relates to their values of integrity, fairness, and being the kind of person they want to be—and explore their willingness to face discomfort for those values. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports such courage by breaking down large, intimidating amends into smaller steps, addressing avoidance thoughts (“I can’t face them”) with cognitive restructuring, and gradually building confidence through successful experiences, which in turn strengthen self‑respect and reduce relapse‑maintaining shame.​",
82,Main text,Into Action,Under no condition do we criticize such a person or argue.,Our real purpose is to fit ourselves to be of maximum service to God and the people about us.,"Guidance is given to avoid criticism and argument during amends, with the broader purpose being to become maximally useful to a higher power and others.","Clinically, this promotes humility and other‑focused behavior during repair, reducing the likelihood of escalating conflicts and keeping the emphasis on one’s own conduct rather than on others’ faults. Motivational interviewing aligns with this by fostering a stance of curiosity and respect in conversations, focusing on understanding the other person’s perspective rather than persuading or defending, which supports constructive dialogue. Cognitive behavioral therapy can help clients prepare for amends conversations by practicing non‑defensive communication and by challenging thoughts that fuel criticism (“They were more at fault than I was”), thereby increasing the chances that the interaction will be healing rather than re‑injuring, and reinforcing the person’s emerging identity as someone who seeks to be of service rather than to win arguments.​",
83,Main text,Into Action,"Yes, there is a long period of reconstruction ahead.",Sometimes we hear an alcoholic say that the only thing he needs to do is to keep sober.,The text acknowledges that recovery involves a long period of reconstruction and counters the idea that simply staying sober is enough.,"Clinically, this emphasizes that while abstinence is necessary, it is not sufficient for full recovery; repairing life domains (work, relationships, emotional health) takes sustained effort. Motivational interviewing can help clients move beyond a minimal goal (“just not drinking”) by exploring what else they want from life and how working on those broader areas might make sobriety more satisfying and sustainable. Cognitive behavioral therapy provides structured tools for reconstruction: setting longer‑term goals, breaking them into steps, addressing mood and anxiety, and developing skills in employment, relationships, and self‑care, so that the person builds a life that makes continued sobriety more attractive and realistic.​",
84,Main text,Into Action,The spiritual life is not a theory. We have to live it.,Our behavior will convince them more than our words.,The text insists that the spiritual life must be lived rather than talked about and that changed behavior is more persuasive than words.,"Clinically, this aligns with the idea that values and beliefs must be embodied in consistent actions to support lasting change and rebuild trust. Motivational interviewing invites clients to describe what living their values looks like in concrete terms (“If someone watched you, how would they know you were living this new way?”), thereby connecting internal commitments to external behaviors. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports this by identifying discrepancies between stated values and actual behavior, developing action plans to close those gaps, and reinforcing behavior change with self‑monitoring and feedback, which helps the person see themselves as genuinely different rather than just talking differently.​",
85,Main text,Into Action,We alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the simple way we have just outlined.,We have entered the world of the Spirit.,"The text notes a lack of self‑discipline and suggests that following the outlined practices is a way of receiving discipline, marking entry into “the world of the Spirit.”","Clinically, this highlights that many people with alcohol use disorder struggle with consistency and self‑regulation, and that structured routines and practices can provide needed external scaffolding. Motivational interviewing explores the person’s feelings about discipline (“What has discipline meant to you in the past?” “What kind of structure actually feels helpful now?”) and helps them choose routines they are willing to adopt, framed as supports rather than punishments. Cognitive behavioral therapy assists in building this discipline through scheduling, habit formation, and contingency planning, linking daily spiritual or value‑based practices (meetings, prayer/meditation, service) with improved mood and reduced relapse risk, thereby turning “the world of the Spirit” into a predictable set of stabilizing habits.​",
86,Main text,Into Action,We must continue to take personal inventory and continue to set right any new mistakes as we go along.,Then we have ceased fighting anything or anyone—even alcohol.,"Ongoing self‑inventory and prompt correction of new mistakes are prescribed, with the goal of reaching a state where one no longer has to fight everything, including alcohol.","Clinically, this describes maintenance work: regularly reviewing behavior, addressing problems early, and moving from constant internal conflict to a more peaceful, responsive stance toward life and cravings. Motivational interviewing can support this ongoing process by periodically revisiting the person’s reasons for continuing these practices and acknowledging their efforts, helping prevent complacency and re‑engage motivation when routines slip. Cognitive behavioral therapy formalizes ongoing inventory as regular self‑monitoring (for example, mood and behavior logs), check‑ins about high‑risk situations, and timely cognitive and behavioral adjustments, which together reduce the need for white‑knuckle “fighting” against urges because problems are dealt with before they escalate.​",
87,Main text,Into Action,And we have ceased fighting anything or anyone—even alcohol.,We have been placed in a position of neutrality—safe and protected.,"The text describes a state where one is no longer at war with people or alcohol, but occupies a “neutral” position where alcohol does not attract or repel. Clinically, this corresponds to a later recovery phase in which craving is reduced, automatic responses are less intense, and sobriety feels more natural and less effortful, though ongoing maintenance is still needed. Motivational interviewing can help people recognize and appreciate reaching this stage (“What is different now about how you relate to alcohol?”), strengthening commitment to continue the practices that led there, and also explore any complacency that might arise from feeling “safe.” Cognitive behavioral therapy emphasizes that “neutrality” is the outcome of sustained skills use and environment shaping; it encourages continued vigilance in identifying subtle high‑risk situations and ensuring that coping plans remain in place, preventing overconfidence from leading back to experimentation with drinking.​",,
88,Main text,Into Action,It is easy to let up on the spiritual program of action and rest on our laurels.,"We are headed for trouble if we do, for alcohol is a subtle foe.","The text warns against relaxing the program and “resting on laurels,” noting that alcohol remains a subtle threat even after progress.","Clinically, this warns of relapse risk due to complacency: when things are going well, people may stop doing the very activities that helped them get better. Motivational interviewing can be used to explore current engagement with recovery practices (“What parts of your program have slipped lately?”) and to revisit the client’s long‑term goals, helping them decide which actions they want to recommit to before problems arise. Cognitive behavioral therapy frames complacency as a cognitive and behavioral lapse—reducing protective factors—that precedes many relapses, and uses relapse‑prevention planning to identify early signs of “letting up” and implement corrective actions (for example, re‑establishing schedules, reconnecting with supports) before use resumes.​",
89,Main text,Into Action,Every day is a day when we must carry the vision of God's will into all of our activities.,How can I best serve Thee—Thy will (not mine) be done.,"Carrying a guiding spiritual vision into daily activities is presented as a daily practice, with a focus on service and aligning one’s will with a higher will.","Clinically, this describes a deliberate, daily values‑based living: asking how to be of service and align actions with guiding principles, which provides a stable framework for decision‑making. Motivational interviewing can help the person define in their own terms what “best serving” looks like in work, family, and community contexts, and how that commitment supports their desire to stay sober and live meaningfully. Cognitive behavioral therapy supports this daily practice by encouraging use of brief morning intentions (for example, setting value‑based goals for the day) and evening reviews, and by addressing any thoughts that pull the person away from service (“I don’t have time to help anyone”) with cognitive restructuring and behavioral experiments that test the impact of small acts of service on mood and craving.​",
90,Main text,Into Action,We alcoholics are undisciplined. So we let God discipline us in the simple way we have just outlined.,For by this time sanity will have returned.,"Returning to the theme of undisciplined alcoholics, the text reiterates that following the outlined practices leads to restored sanity by this stage.","Clinically, “sanity” here refers to more balanced thinking about alcohol and life: no longer insisting on drinking despite evidence, and making more realistic, less self‑destructive decisions. Motivational interviewing can highlight examples of regained sanity (“What decisions are you making now that you never would have made before?”), helping the person see how their efforts have improved judgment and reinforcing continued adherence to their chosen disciplines. Cognitive behavioral therapy conceptualizes this restored sanity as improved cognitive functioning: fewer distortions, better problem‑solving, and greater impulse control; it encourages ongoing skill use and periodic review of thinking patterns to maintain this stability, recognizing that lapses in practice can gradually erode these gains if left unchecked.",
